  POLITICS_AULUS_SEVERUS_DESC:0 "Aulus Severus is the legate of Legio IX Hispana, born in Roman Spain around 80 AD. He served in campaigns against barbarians, distinguished himself in Britain under Agricola. In 121 AD, the legion vanished in the mist — now we know it was a time rift. In 1936, Aulus, a man of iron will and strict discipline, sees in the new world a chance to revive the Roman Empire. His charisma inspires legionaries to adapt to 'barbarian' technologies."
